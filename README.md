## Introduction

Plant diseases are a significant threat to global agricultural productivity. Traditional methods of disease identification involve manual inspection, which is time-consuming, prone to error, and requires expert knowledge. This project provides a scalable and automated solution using CNNs for feature extraction and Fuzzy Logic for refining classification decisions.

**Key Features:**
- **Deep Learning:** A CNN model trained on 83,000+ images of plant leaves.
- **Fuzzy Logic:** Added to improve decision-making in uncertain cases.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Capable of making fast and accurate classifications.

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains:
- **Images:** Over 83,000 labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
- **Classes:** Multiple plant species and disease categories.

### Data Preprocessing:
1. Cleaning and Normalization: Rescaled pixel values to [0, 1].
2. Augmentation: Applied techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting to enhance dataset diversity.
3. Resizing: All images were resized to 128x128 pixels for uniformity.

### **Key Observations**
1. **High Accuracy for Most Classes**:  
   The model achieves near-perfect accuracy for diseases with distinct symptoms, such as *Corn (maize)___Common_rust* and *Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus*.
   
2. **Struggles with Similar Diseases**:  
   Some diseases, such as *Tomato___Early_blight* and *Tomato___Late_blight*, had overlapping symptoms, resulting in slightly lower precision and recall scores.
   
3. **Fuzzy Logic Contribution**:  
   Fuzzy logic improved predictions for borderline confidence scores, enhancing reliability for diseases with subtle differences.


**Visualizations:**
- Confusion matrix, accuracy/loss curves, and sample predictions are included in the results.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Similar Symptoms:** Differentiating between diseases with similar visual symptoms.
2. **Data Imbalance:** Some classes had significantly fewer samples, affecting performance.
3. **High-Resolution Images:** Computationally intensive processing of high-resolution images.
